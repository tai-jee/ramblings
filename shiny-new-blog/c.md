testing and stuff and whatever

Yeah I've been procrastinating putting this together for actual months now but I've finally gotten around to it.  
It probably looks like turbo ass, but if it works and you can actually read the shit that I'm typing, I don't care at this point.

I've yet to have the doohickey sort the whatchamacallits by the time stamp so they're not in some random ass order, but that's a job for future me once he's taken his meds.

Progress is progress.
